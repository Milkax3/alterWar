=== How to run the Server (and play on it) ===

Thats just easier than you may thought.
Configure the Server.ini in the \Data\ Folder where
the executables is located at.

Then go to C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\ and open
the file "hosts" with an normal text editor (eg. Notepad++).

Add an line with
127.0.0.1 login.warrock.net

To explain: 127.0.0.1 is the IP you put as GAME server IP.
When you change the IP to 0.0.0.0, nobody can connect
to your server.

And login.warrock.net is the normal login Server, you use to login
with your original account.

Then just save it (if it won't work, save as .txt on desktop, remove the .txt
and move it to the C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\ Folder).

Alright, now when you start WarRock, warrock will try to connect to
127.0.0.1 instead of login.warrock.net.

Its like... An "image" explains more than 1000 words:

Game -> DNS Lookup (login.warrock.net) -> 8.8.8.8 (let's say 8.8.8.8 is login.warrock.net)
DNS Lookup -> C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts -> Search for login.warrock.net
login.warrock.net found as 127.0.0.1! We don't need to look anymore.
Game -> 127.0.0.1

And if you DON'T do this, it will work like this:

Game -> 8.8.8.8



=== Play normally again ===

Just add a # at the beginning of the line to comment the line out.
This means, the DNS Lookup won't check that line.
